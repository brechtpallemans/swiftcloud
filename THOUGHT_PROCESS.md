### step 1: download data

### step 2: start a Taylor Swift playlist 

### step 3: create a backend project using NestJS

Why?

- Interview requires TypeScript experience, great way to show that off using NestJS
- Comes with out of the box TypeORM support, useful to generate migrations for a Postgres DB
- Out of the box API routing and swagger API documentation
- Dependency Injection, great architecture to scale if the app ever get's millions of songs.

How?

Follow [the official documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps) to start a new sub directory under this project:

```

> npm
```
